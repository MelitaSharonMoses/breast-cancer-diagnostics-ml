# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

# 1\. Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project aimed at classifying breast tumors as either **benign** (non-cancerous) or **malignant** (cancerous). The project is built using Python within a Jupyter Notebook, providing a clear and reproducible data science workflow. This serves as a practical demonstration of applying classification models to real-world medical diagnostic challenges.
The primary goal is to build and evaluate a predictive model that can assist in the early detection of breast cancer by accurately classifying tumors based on their diagnostic features.
# 2\. Dataset
The project uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, a classic and widely-used dataset for classification tasks. It is conveniently available directly through the `scikit-learn` library.
The dataset includes:
  * **569 instances** (samples of breast masses).
  * **30 features** computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA), such as `radius_mean`, `texture_mean`, and `perimeter_mean`.
  * A binary **target variable** (`diagnosis`) indicating whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
# 3\. Methodology & Workflow
The analysis and modeling are performed within a single Jupyter Notebook (`breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb`), following a standard machine learning pipeline:
1.  **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**: The dataset is loaded and explored to understand its structure, check for missing values, and analyze the distribution of the target variable.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps) are used to gain insights into the data and the relationships between features.
3.  **Data Preprocessing**: The data is split into training and testing sets to prepare it for model training and to ensure an unbiased evaluation.
4.  **Model Training**: Several classification models, including **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Random Forest**, are trained on the preprocessed data.
5.  **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is evaluated using a variety of metrics. The **Confusion Matrix**, **Precision**, and **Recall** are used to provide a detailed view of the model's predictive capabilities, with a strong emphasis on maximizing **Recall** for the malignant class to minimize false negatives.
# 4\. Results & Key Findings
The models demonstrated high accuracy in classifying tumors. The **Random Forest Classifier** was found to be the top-performing model, achieving a high score on all key metrics. The project's most critical finding is the model's ability to achieve a high **Recall score** on the malignant class, which is essential for medical applications where missing a positive case can have serious consequences.
